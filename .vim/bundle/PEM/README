ABOUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Plugin is intended to fold every single Cert in a PEM Certificat.

It will match on these filename extensions for X.509 certificates:

    .pem – (Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail) Base64 encoded DER certificate,
           enclosed between "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and
           "-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
    .p12 – PKCS#12, may contain certificate(s) (public) and private keys
           (password protected)
    .pfx – PFX, predecessor of PKCS#12 (usually contains data in PKCS#12 
           format, e.g., with PFX files generated in IIS)
    .cer, .crt, .der – usually in binary DER form, but Base64-encoded
                       certificates are common too (see .pem above)
    .p7b, .p7c – PKCS#7 SignedData structure without data, just certificate(s)
                 or CRL(s)
    (origin: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509)
and also PEM Certificates with no file-ending.

These days it only fold lines matching ^-----B, maybe when there is enough time,
it'll also fold at these places. Intendet foldlevels [n]

INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you use pathogen Plugin for vim, put the entire folder in your ~/.vim/bundle.
If you don't use pathogen Plugin, you have to do it - back to the roots -
adjust your vim runtimepath (see :help 'runtimepath') and put the files in a
location recodnized by your runtimepath. Or just install pathogen, it makes it
much easier to update your plugins. 

Installing Pathogen Plugin is quiet easy, just enter:

mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle
curl -LSso ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim https://tpo.pe/pathogen.vim
